## Planning & Delivery

### Defining MVP 
- Defined the core requirements of the application and added each requirement as tickets in a trello board 
- Went through each ticket as a team to ensure we are all aligned with the requirments and how we intend to tackle the ticket 

### Communication
- We used Slack as the single method of communication on this project
- Worked on individual branches and merged to main once it was communicated with the rest of the team 
- Single point of truth for this application was stored on Figma
- Planned regular catch up sessions throughout the day for updates on tickets and whether we need to re-align/re-distribute work 

### UX/UI Planning
- Found a few examples of similar journalling websites and took screenshots
- Using Figma, went through website examples and discussed likes/dislikes as a team
- Created brand guidelines and designs
