# Process

[How did you go about creating this project]

Agreed on our way of working 
- Agreed on a single method of communication about this project (slack)
- Agreed on what branches we will work in and will only merge in main after communicating to the rest of the team via slack 
- Agreed where our single point of truth for this application will be stored (Figma) 
- Agreed a rough plan of how we intend the week to go 

Defining and refining  
- Defined the core requirements of the application and added each requirement as tickets in a trello board  
- Went through each ticket as a team to ensure we are all aligned with the requirments and how we indend to tackle the ticket 

Design planning 
- Found a few examples of similar journalling websites and took screenshots
- Using Figma, as a team we went through each of these example screenshots and discussed likes/dislikes
- As a team we decided how our application will look

Organising and planning 
- Assigned a few tickets to each team memeber 
- Planned regular catch up sessions each day (morning, afternoon, evening) to see how everyone is doing and if we need to re-align/re-distribute work
